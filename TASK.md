# The Task

Our newest publication, The Daily Moon, wants to leave black-and-white behind and embrace a more colourful, maximalist design on its article pages. Their top priority is making headlines more eye-catching…

**Your task today is to build a custom Gutenberg block that allows editors to create these funky headlines!**

## What are the requirements?

The new headline block must include three parts:
- a kicker
- a main headline
- a subdeck

Editors need to be able to customise the background colour of the kicker, as well as the text colour of the main headline.

There should also be limits on the length of the kicker (20 chars), headline (80 chars) and subdeck (150 chars).

**Remember you can use `@wordpress/create-block` to scaffold your plugin and `wp-env` to run it locally.**
