There are personal challenges for the royals, but new links are being forged with “kind words”, as King Charles has said, between the public and the Palace.

		description: `How To Win An Election is an insider’s guide to the twists and turns of political campaigning and strategy. It brings together some of the most experienced political advisors of the past four decades - Daniel Finkelstein, Sally Morgan, and Polly Mackenzie - with Times Radio presenter Hugo Rifkind.

            Sally Morgan served as Blair's political secretary and then as director of political and government relations; she understands the challenge of leading the country when there are tensions with the Treasury, an unpredictable ally in the White House, and unrest on the backbenches.

            Nobody knows the highs and lows of the Conservative party better than Daniel Finkelstein, who has worked alongside Tory leaders and prime ministers from John Major onwards as they fought to modernise the party.
            
            And Polly Mackenzie is one of the smartest thinkers in Westminster, a policy expert who helped negotiate the Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition and spent five years working alongside deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in Downing Street.
            
            They sit down with Hugo Rifkind for an intelligent, adversarial and witty political conversation every week.
